The RadioWare laboratory\nexercises utilize two bench configurations: a Student Team Bench and a Lab\nAssistant Bench. Each lab section will have one Student Team Bench for each\ngroup of 2-3 students as well as 1-2 Lab Assistant Benches. The equipment,\nconnections, software, and other configurations of these benches are described\nbelow. Finally, the instructors and teaching assistants will prepare an\nEducational Radio Kit for each student group as outlined in this document.\n\n## Student Team Bench\n\nThe Student Team Bench provides intermediate frequency (IF) test and measurement\ncapabilities, power supplies, and a desktop computer for instrument control,\nvisualization, and software development. An example Student Team Bench is\npictured below.\n\n![Student Team Bench](images/Student_Bench.jpg)\n\n### Components\n\nThe components and minimum requirements for a Student Team Bench include:\n\n- Intermediate Frequency (IF) Mixed Signal Oscilloscope\n\n  - At least four (4) analog input channels\n  - At least sixteen (16) digital input channels\n  - At least 100 MHz input bandwidth\n  - e.g.,\n    [Keysight MSOX3014T](https://www.keysight.com/en/pdx-x202181-pn-MSOX3014T/)\n\n  ![Keysight MSOX3014T Oscilloscope](images/KeysightMSOX3014TScope.jpeg)\n\n- Wall Power Adapter\n\n  - 3 pole AC inlet IEC320-C14, Class I power unit\n  - Offers the output voltage sets +5V/+12V/-5V\n  - e.g.,\n    [MEAN WELL GP25A](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/GP25A13A-R1B/7703336)\n\n  ![MEAN WELL GP25A-R1B Power Adapter](images/GP25A.png)\n\n- Desktop Computer and Display\n\n### Setup\n\n1.

the high-level requirements and selected software\ncomponents. Each semester the course development team surveys the software\nlandscape to update this section, with an emphasis on keeping the number of\ndependencies and constraints and small as possible, and the installation\ninstructions as robust as possible.\n\nAlthough much of the software is compatible with various operating systems\nincluding Linux and Mac OS X, these instructions are for the laboratory\ncomputers with Windows installed. Users of other operating systems who come up\nwith a robust set of installation instructions are welcome to share them with\nthe course development team for inclusion on this document.\n\n<!-- Should we create our own \"distribution\" like Anaconda does for machine learning? Perhaps companies like Analog Devices and Keysight would sponsor it? -->\n\n### High-Level Requirements\n\nThe high-level software requirements for the RadioWare courseware are as\nfollows:\n\n- Interface support selected hardware, including: ADALM-2000, ADALM Pluto, and\n  Keysight Test and Measurement Equipment\n- Numerical Python, including Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, JupyText and\n  Jupyter Notebook\n- Link performance applications, including FFmpeg, iPerf, and Wireshark\n\n### Hardware Dependency Analysis\n\nBecause the hardware is so critical, we start with a review of the state of\nhardware drivers, their requirements, and baseline installations. From this\nanalysis, we determine the additional software that must be installed.\n\n### ADALM-2000 / ADALM-Pluto Drivers\n\n- Webpage:\n  [https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win/releases](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win/releases)\n\n### LibM2K\n\n- Webpage:\n  [https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libm2k/releases/tag/v0.5.0](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libm2k/releases/tag/v0.5.0)\n- Requires: ADALM Pluto/2000 drivers and Python 3.8.10 (select the Python 3.8\n  bindings option)\n\n### PyADI-IIO\n\n- Webpage: Install using Python package installer pip\n- Requires: LibIIO with Python bindings (pylibiio == 0.23.1) and NumPy\n\n### Keysight IO Libraries Suite\n\n- Webpage: www.keysight.com/find/iosuite\n- Requires: Python\n- Installs: VISA Library (along with others)\n\n### Firmware Updates\n\n- Oscilloscope: Keysight MSOX3014T firmware version 7.50.20211028 retrieved from\n  [https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/instrument-firmware-software/installing-infiniivision-3000t-xseries-oscilloscope-firmware-2573488.html](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/instrument-firmware-software/installing-infiniivision-3000t-xseries-oscilloscope-firmware-2573488.html)\n  and installed using an USB drive.\n- Spectrum Analyzer: Keysight N9914B FieldFox firmware version A.12.35 from\n  [https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/instrument-firmware-software/fieldfox-current-firmware-new-cpu-2637691.html](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/instrument-firmware-software/fieldfox-current-firmware-new-cpu-2637691.html)\n  (USB drive)\n\n### Installation Instructions\n\n**Key Note:** Try to run all the setups as administrator and select any path in\nC drive other than your user folder if that option is available. You can also\nverify this later by making sure that the folder path of the executable file\ndoes not contain your username.\n\n#### Google Chrome and Git\n\n**Install Google Chrome**\n[https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/?standalone=1](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/?standalone=1)\nCopy the setup file to a location in the C drive and the run the installer, also\nmake it the default browser.\n\n**Install GitHub Desktop**\n[https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/7582](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/7582)\nPlease follow the second comment by 'steveward' and install the .msi file (as\nadministrator). Whenever a new user logs in the PC, GitHub Desktop auto installs\nitself on that users folder. This will be beneficial as we don't have to take\nspecial care for cloning the entire course folder from GitHub.\n\nNote: We can install TeamViewer in case we need remote access.\n\n#### Python\n\n1.  Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/)\n    and scroll down to the Files section and click on the recommended Windows\n    installer (64-bit). As a safe intermediate step you may first uninstall the\n    currenly Python 3.7.4 version that you have by running the installer and\n    selecting the uninstall option.\n\n2.  Right click and run the installer you just downloaded as administrator and\n    then select `Add Python 3.8 to PATH` in the checkbox shown at the bottom of\n    the installation page. Click \"Custom Installation\" and follow the steps, we\n    need to make sure that the folder path is general and not in our user.\n\n3.  Congratulations! You have just succesfully installed Python. To check if\n    Python is properly installed and added to PATH, first open the \"Command\n    Prompt\" by typing `cmd` in your Cortana search box. Then, type `python` in\n    your command window and press \"Enter\". You should expect to see information\n    similar to the following:\n\n    ```\n    PPython 3.8.10 (tags/v3.8.10:3d8993a, May 3 2021, 11:48:03) [MSC v.1928 64 bit\n    (AMD64)] on win32 Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more\n    information. Type \"quit()\" to exit Python and return to the command window.\n    ```\n\n4.  Now run the command prompt as an administrator and upgrade your pip package\n    by running `pip install --upgrade pip` command.\n\n#### Numpy, MatPlotLib, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook, JupyText and PySimpleGUI\n\n1.  Once we have Python installed, we could install other tools such as NumPy,\n    MatPlotLib, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook, JupyText and PySimpleGUI using the \"pip\n    install\" command (run command window as administrator then it should show\n    C:\\system\\windows32 and not your username). Type pip install xyz in thr\n    command window; the xyz should be replaced (one by one) by numpy,\n    matplotlib, scipy, notebook, jupytext and pysimplegui.\n2.  To test whether all these packages are installed and can be imported we can\n    use command prompt and start python, then use the command import\n    'package-name' and press enter (for pysimplegui use PySimpleGUI, check\n    [https://yasoob.me/2013/07/28/what-is-**init**-py/](https://yasoob.me/2013/07/28/what-is-__init__-py/)\n    for more details).\n\n_Note:_ a) NumPy library is a collection of mathematical functions and it\nsupports arrays and matrices. b) MatPlotLib library used for Matlab like\nplotting. c) SciPy library has modules that can be used for scientific\ncomputational tasks such as optimization, linear algebra, etc. d) PySimpleGUI\nlibrary is used for fast and simple GUI programming. e) JupyText is used to open\nJupyter notebooks as text files.\n\n#### ADALM-2000 and Pluto Drivers\n\n1. Visit\n   [https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win/releases](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win/releases)\n   and download \"PlutoSDR-M2k-USB-Drivers.exe - v0.8\" and install it.<br>\n\n_Note:_ These drivers set up communication between our PC and ADALM Pluto/M2K\n(interfacing software or applications to hardware).<br>\n\n#### LibIIO\n\n1. Visit\n   [https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/releases](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/releases)\n   and download the .exe file and run installer as admin.<br>\n\n_Note:_ Abstracts low-level details of hardware and provides and simple yet\ncomplete programming interface to ease development.<br>\n\n#### LibM2K\n\n1.  Visit\n    [https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libm2k/releases/tag/v0.5.0](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libm2k/releases/tag/v0.5.0)\n    and click to download the libm2k Windows installer\n    \"libm2k-0.5.0-Windows-setup.exe\"\n2.  Run the installer (as administrator) and make sure to deselect just the\n    option 'install Python 3.7 bindings', then click next to finish installing\n    libm2k on your Windows system.\n3.  To check the installation we should again run the command 'import libm2k' in\n    the python terminal (in command prompt type python and click enter).<br>\n\nThe idea of first installing libiio and then overwriting it is taken from the\nquestion thread\n[https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libm2k/issues/98.<br>](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libm2k/issues/98.<br>)\n\n_Note:_ C++ library for interfacing with ADALM2000.<br>\n\n#### PyADI-IIO\n\n1. Run \"pip install pyadi-iio\" to finish installation (as admin).\n2. To check installation run 'import adi' in Python terminal, refer\n   [https://pypi.org/project/pyadi-iio/.<br>](https://pypi.org/project/pyadi-iio/.<br>)\n\n_Note:_ Python abstraction (reducing details) module for ADI hardware.<br>\n\n#### PyVISA\n\n1. Open command prompt window (as admin) and type: pip install pyvisa.\n2.

Extract the downloaded zip file (in the C drive) then in the unzipped folder\n   \"iperf-2.0.9-win64\" find the executable named \"iperf\".\n3. Again, copy the directory path in the address bar of Windows Explorer and add\n   it to \"PATH\" under system environment variables.<br>\n\n_Note:_ Tool to actively measure the max achievable bandwidth on a\nconnection.<br>\n\n#### WireShark\n\n1. Download the Wireshark installer by visiting\n   [https://www.wireshark.org/download.html](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)\n2. Run the installer (as administrator) and follow the instructions to install\n   Wireshark on your computer. Make sure you install the Npcap Loopback Adapter\n   during the installation.<br>\n\n_Note:_ Open source cross-platform packet analyzer for troubleshooting and\nanalysis of a network.<br>\n\n### Uninstallation Instructions\n\nIn case a computer needs to be refreshed, we include these instructions to\nremove everything before trying to install the software above from scratch.\n\n1. First Step is to uninstall everything that is relevent to all the software\n   mentioned above using control panel.\n2. The above includes stuff related to GitHub, IVI, Keysight, Libiio & m2k,\n   Microsoft Visual C++/studio, NpCap, Pluto/M2k drivers, Python, VISA, Wibukey,\n   ADI Driver packages Windows, Wireshark.\n3. Now we need to manually delete some folders in the C drive as follows: a)\n   Remove ffmpeg and iperf from system path environment variables and delete\n   those folders in C drive. b) Go to 'Program files' and first delete Python38,\n   then delete IVI and Keysight related folders too. c) Go to 'Program files\n   (x86)' and delete Agilent, GitHub, IVI, Keysight, Visual Studio, NI and\n   Wibukey related folders. d) Go to the hidden folder (select view hidden in\n   the file explorer) 'Program Data' and delete Agilent, IVI and Keysight. e) Go\n   to Users and then to your folder. Now first go to Documents and delete the\n   GitHub folder (radioware repository) and come back to Users folder. Then\n   delete .ipython, .jupyter, .matplotlib folders and .gitconfig file. Also go\n   to the hidden folder 'AppData', delete GitHub and Jupyter folder in Roaming.\n   Now go to the local folder and first delete the pip folder and then delete\n   GitHub, Keysight and temp folders. f) Go to Windows folder and delete\n   Temp.<br>\n\nYou can now restart the machine.\n\n### Summary of Software Versions\n\n| Software                           | Version       |\n| :--------------------------------- | :------------ |\n| Google Chrome                      | 96.0.4664.111 |\n| GitHub Desktop                     | 2.9.6         |\n| Python                             | 3.8.10        |\n| ADALM Pluto/2000 Drivers           | 0.8           |\n| libiio                             | 0.23.0        |\n| libm2k                             | 0.5.0         |\n| pyadi-iio                          | 0.0.11        |\n| Keysight Instrument Control Bundle | 2020          |\n| ffmpeg                             | 4.4.1         |\n| iPerf                              | 2.0.9         |\n| Wireshark                          | 3.6.1         |\n| NumPy                              | 1.21.1        |\n| MatPlotLib                         | 3.5.0         |\n| SciPy                              | 1.7.3         |\n| Jupyter Notebook                   | 6.4.6         |\n| PySimpleGUI                        | 4.55.1        |\n| JupyText                           | 1.13.5        |\n| PyVISA                             | 1.11.3        |\n\n: Software Versions for Spring 2022 (as of January 3, 2022)\n{#tbl-software-versions}\n\n",
