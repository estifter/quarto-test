The\nlatest offering of this course in Spring 2022.\n\n---\n\n| Role               | Name                | Office               | Email                                       | Photo                             |\n| :----------------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- |\n| Instructor, PI     | J.

Remember that asking\nquestions - whether in class or lab - is a sign of engagement in the material,\nnot an expression of weakness!\n\n## Office Hours\n\nThe instructor will not schedule formal office hours, but will be available\nimmediately before or after lecture and at the start of lab sections to address\nstudent questions on all aspects of the course.\n\nThe engineering staff and teaching assistant will be very available during lab\nsections to assist students with lab work and address broader questions about\nhomework and other technical course content.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the instruction staff have many other responsibilities,\nso try to make the most of these built-in opportunities for interaction.\n\nIf an issue cannot be adequately addressed at the above times, or if you need\nadditional help, we may be able to briefly meet with you individually; send us\ne-mail to try to schedule an appointment, or feel free to drop by our offices\nwhenever the door is open.\n\n## Course & Reference Materials\n\nThe course development and instruction team will be preparing lecture notes,\nhomework and quiz problems, and labs exercises that will be distributed at the\nappropriate times. Together with an evolving educational radio kit for\nlaboratory exercises, we have started to refer to all these materials as\n_RadioWare_. Your careful review of, feedback on, and even contribution to these\nmaterials will be very appreciated.\n\nThe required textbook for the course is:\n\n- Michael Rice, _Digital Communications: A Discrete-Time Approach_, Second\n  Edition, Self Published, 2020. Available from Amazon at\n  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GVGCKCC](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GVGCKCC)\n\nFurthermore, there are several recommended reference texts from which may we\nselect some content and exercises:\n\n- Travis F. Collins, Robin Getz, Di Pu, and Alexander M. Wyglinski,\n  _Software-Defined Radio for Engineers_, Artech House, 2018. Available online\n  at\n  [https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/software-defined-radio-for-engineers.html](https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/software-defined-radio-for-engineers.html)\n- David L. Adamy, _Introduction to Electronic Warfare Modeling and Simulation_,\n  SciTech Publishing, 2006. Available online at\n  [https://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpIEWMS004/introduction-electronic/introduction-electronic](https://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpIEWMS004/introduction-electronic/introduction-electronic)\n\n## Homework\n\nHomework will consist of problem sets and lab reports, each described in further\ndetail below. You are expected to complete all assigned homework problems and\nlab exercises, though a randomly chosen subset will likely be graded.\n\nAlthough the grade you get on your homework is only one component of your course\ngrade, working through, and often struggling at length with, the problem sets\nand lab exercises is a crucial part of the learning process and will invariably\nhave a major impact on your understanding of the material. This understanding\nwill, in turn, be reflected in your exam performance and overall course grade.\n\nSome items in the problem sets and lab execises may be labeled as \"Optional\".\nYou can make use of these items if you feel you might benefit from some\nadditional exposure to the material or if you are simply interested. Optional\nitems we will not be graded, but we will provide solutions to them along with\nthose for the regular problems.\n\n### Problem Sets\n\nThere will be problem sets approximately every week.\n\nWe expect to issue problem sets Mondays and have them due a week and a half\nlater on Wednesdays at the end of class. Solutions will be distributed at the\nend of the due dateâ€™s lecture; consequently, late problem sets cannot be\nseriously evaluated.\n\nModerate collaboration with one or two classmates is permitted, provided your\nwriteups are your own.\n\n### Lab Exercises & Reports\n\nLaboratory work will serve as an important reinforcement and extension of topics\ncovered in lectures.\n\nThe lab exercises aim to familiarize students with practical issues in building\nand testing radio communication systems, including the areas of analog and\ndigital hardware, software programming, measurements, and technical\ndocumentation.\n\nLab exercises will primarily be worked during lab sections, but students will be\nable to access the equipment outside of lab sections subject to coordination\nwith the instruction team.\n\nLab work will be conducted in teams of 2 students, but lab reports should be\nwritten up separately.\n\n## Quizzes & Exam\n\n### Concept Quizzes\n\nAt the end of each learning module, we will have an short, in-class \"concept\nquiz\" to check understanding and provide feedback to the instruction team.\n\nWe expect learning modules to collect related topics and last about 3 weeks, on\naverage.\n\nSuggestions for quiz problems are always welcome, and come with an obvious\nbenefit to you if your problem is chosen!\n\n### Midterm Exam\n\nEach student will meet individually in the lab with members of the course\ndevelopment and instruction team and will be asked to assemble a functioning\ncommunications system using the lab kit. They will be evaluated on their methods\nand overall success. Students should also be prepared to address questions about\ncourse topics covered up to the date of the midterm exam.\n\nWe anticipate scheduling the midterm exams during the lab sections the week just\nbefore Spring Break, February 28 and March 02, 2022.\n\nThis exam is designed to ensure that each student (outside of a group dynamic)\nis absorbing the course concepts and becoming proficient in the lab setting.\n\n## Final Project\n\nThe last several lab sections, nominally 4, will provide student groups with the\nopportunity to extend the lab kit to address a challenging scenario related to\ncongested and contested radio spectrum.\n\nThe final scenario will be suggested by the instruction team and their research\ncollaborators, and students will propose a solution, develop and test it, and\npresent it to the class and instruction team for feedback along the way.\n\nSpecifically, after the first week students will present their approaches to\neach other for anonymous \"red-team\" peer critique. Weeks two and three will be\nspent implementing the proposed team solution. In the fourth and final week,\nresearch collaborators will be invited to visit campus or participate via web\nconference for final review of presentations and demonstrsations.\n\nWe anticipate scheduling the final project presentations and demonstrations\nduring the lab sections the last week of class, April 29 and 30, 2020.\n\n## Course Grade\n\nYour course grade will be based upon our best assessment of your understanding\nof the material covered during the semester. Roughly, the weights used in the\ngrade assignment will be:\n\n- Homework: 30% (Nominally Problem Sets: 10%, Lab Reports: 20%)\n- Concept Quizzes: 20%\n- Midterm Exam: 25%\n- Final Project: 25%\n\nHowever, other factors such as participation and interactions in meetings can\nmake a non-negligible difference in the course grade. In general, the process of\nassigning a course grade involves careful review of performance in all aspects\nof the course. Although the focus of the course is obviously learning, not\ngrades, we know the course grade is important to you, and we want you to know\nthat we take the process seriously.\n\n",
