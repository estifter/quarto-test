## Summary

In this lecture, we will see how we can remove redundacies in AM modulation and
demodulation processes.

## Outline

- Single Sideband

- Quadrature Multiplexing

## Single Sideband (SSB) AM Modulation

### Motivation: Redundancy in the Sidebands for DSB-SC

For DSB-SC, we have

$$
  s(t) = m(t)\cos(2\pi f_c t) \leftrightarrow S(f)=\frac{1}{2}[M(f-f_c) + M(f+f_c)]
$$

From this illustration, we see that each "sideband" is copied twice. Is that
necessary?

Can we instead recover from the following modulated signals?

Note that these alternative modulated signals have passband bandwidth $B$
instead of $2B$ for DSC-SC!

If we carefully consider on DSC-SC demodulator, we see that it can be used to
recover the message signal.

### Analytic Signal Representation of SSB

Let

\begin{align} M*{+}(f) &:= M(f)u(f) \\ M*{-}(f) &:= M(f)u(-f) \end{align}

where we define

$$
  u(f):=
\begin{cases}
1 & f > 0 \\
\frac{1}{2} & f=0 \\
0 & f < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Then $M(f) = M_{+}(f) + M_{-}(f)$.

Furthermore, if $m(t)$ is real-valued, we have $M_{+}(f)=M_{-}^*(-f)$ for
$f\ge 0$, so it is clear that $M_{+}(f)$ (or $M_{-}(f)$) completely specifies
$M(f)$.

The signal $M_{+}(f)$ is called an _analytic signal_ that consists of only
positive frequencies, and therefore $M_{+}(f)$ provides the _analytic signal
representation_ of $M(f)$.

Now

\begin{align} S*\mathrm{USB}(f) &= M*{+}(f-f*c) + M*{-}(f+f*c) \\
S*\mathrm{LSB}(f) &= M*{-}(f-f_c) + M*{+}(f+f_c) \end{align}

The signal $S_{\mathrm{USB}}(f)$ is called the _upper sideband (USB)
representation_ of $M(f)$, while $S_{\mathrm{LSB}}(f)$ is called the _lower
sideband (LSB) representation_ of $m(t)$. Both representations are called
_single sideband (SSB)_ representations of $M(f)$.

**EXERCISE:** Verify that there are no other real-valued SSB representations of
a real signal.

Although intuitive in the frequency domain, the SSB representations are not
particularly insightful in the time domain. In particular, the filter $u(f)$ is
not realizable and needs to be approximated at the origin.

### The Hilbert Transform

Consider the LTI frequency response

$$
  H(f):=-j\mathrm{sgn}(f)=\begin{cases}
e^{-j\pi/2} & f > 0 \\
0 & f=0 \\
e^{+j\pi/2} & f < 0
\end{cases} \leftrightarrow h(t)=\frac{1}{\pi t}
$$

**TBD: Insert diagram of magnitude and phase responses**

**Defintion:** The _Hilbert Trasnsform_ $x_h(t) \leftrightarrow X_h(f)$ of a
signal $x(t) \leftrightarrow X(f)$ is the output of the LTI system with
frequency respopnse $H(f)=-j\mathrm{sgn}(f)$ if $x(t)$ is the input.

That is,

$$
  X_h(f) = -j\mathrm{sgn}(f)X(f) \leftrightarrow x_h(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{x(\tau)}{\pi(t-\tau)} d\tau
$$

**Example:** The Hilbert Transform of $\cos(2\pi f_c t)$ is $-\sin(2\pi f_c t)$

**Example:** The analytic signal $X_{+}(f)$ can be written in terms of the
Hilbert Transform as follows

$$
  X_{+}(f) = \frac{1}{2}\left[X(f) + j X_h(f) \right]
$$

Similarly,

$$
  X_{-}(f) = \frac{1}{2}\left[X(f) - j X_h(f) \right]
$$

### Hilbert Transform Representation of SSB

Applying the example above to $S_{\mathrm{USB}}(f)$, we have

\begin{align} S*{\mathrm{USB}}(f) &= M*{+}(f-f*c) + M*{-}(f+f_c) \\ &=
\frac{1}{2}\left[M(f-f_c)+jM_h(f-f_c) \right] +
\frac{1}{2}\left[M(f+f_c)-jM_h(f+f_c) \right] \\ &=
\frac{1}{2}\left[M(f-f_c)+M(f+f_c) \right] -
\frac{1}{2j}\left[M_h(f-f_c)-M_h(f+f_c) \right] \end{align}

so that

$$
  s_\mathrm{USB}(t) = m(t)\cos(2\pi f_c t) - m_h(t)\sin(2\pi f_c t)
$$

Similary, we have

\begin{align} S*{\mathrm{LSB}}(f) &= M*{-}(f-f*c) + M*{+}(f+f_c) \\ &=
\frac{1}{2}\left[M(f-f_c)-jM_h(f-f_c) \right] +
\frac{1}{2}\left[M(f+f_c)+jM_h(f+f_c) \right] \\ &=
\frac{1}{2}\left[M(f-f_c)+M(f+f_c) \right] +
\frac{1}{2j}\left[M_h(f-f_c)-M_h(f+f_c) \right] \end{align}

so that

$$
  s_\mathrm{LSB}(t) = m(t)\cos(2\pi f_c t) + m_h(t)\sin(2\pi f_c t)
$$

The take away is that, by modulating the right signal onto the sine of the same
frequency as the cosine carrier signal, we elimninate the redundancy sidebands.

## Quadrature

With sine carrier signal also available to us, we can also consider mdulating
two separate baseband signals. This technique is called _quadrature multiplexing
(QM)_.

### Quadrature Multiplexing

Specifically, let $m(t)=m_{R}(t)+jm_{I}(t)$, where $m_{R}(t)$ and $m_{I}(t)$ are
two baseband signals bandlimited to maximum frequency $B$.

Now consider

\begin{align} s*{\mathrm{QM}}(t) &= \mathrm{Re}\left\{m(t)e^{j2\pi f_c t}
\right\} \\ &=\mathrm{Re}\left\{(m*{R}(t)+jm\_{I}(t))(\cos(2\pi f_c
t)+j\sin(2\pi f_c t))\right\} \\ &= m_R(t)\cos(2\pi f_c t) - m_I(t)\sin(2\pi f_c
t) \end{align}

We see that we have **two** signal of baseband bandwidth $B$ now occupying the
passband bandwidth of $2B$ for $s_{\mathrm{QM}}(t)$.

## Quadrature Demultiplexing

There are several ways to view recovery of $m(t)$ from $s_{\mathrm{QM}}(t)$.

$$
  s_{\mathrm{QM}}(t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[m(t)e^{j2\pi f_c t} + m^*(t) e^{-j2\pi f_c t} \right]
$$

so that

$$
  s_{\mathrm{QM}}(t)e^{-j2\pi f_c t} = \frac{1}{2}\left[m(t)+ m^*(t) e^{-j2\pi (2f_c) t} \right]
$$

The second term can be filtered out with a lowpass filter, so that we can
recover $m(t)$ as shown in the figure below.

A few comments are in order:

- The cross terms $m_R(t)\sin(2\pi f_c t)\cos(2\pi f_c t)$ and
  $m_I(t)\cos(2\pi f_c t)\sin(2\pi f_c t)$ are eliminated via filtering, so that
  there is no interference between $m_R(t)$ and $m_I(t)$.

- $m_R(t)\cos(2\pi f_c t)$ is called the _in-phase (I) component_, and
  $m_I(t)\sin(2\pi f_c t)$ is called the _quadrature (Q) component_
