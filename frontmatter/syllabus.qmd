## Meetings

Lecture days and times will be:

- _Lectures:_ Mondays, Wednesdays, & Fridays, 12:50-1:40pm, 105 Pasquerilla
  Center

Lab Section days and times will be:

- _Lab Section 1:_ Mondays, 3:30-6:30pm, 116 Cushing Hall

- _Lab Section 2:_ Thursdays, 3:30-6:30pm, 116 Cushing Hall

Meetings work best (and are most fun) when they are highly interactive, so your
participation is important and strongly encouraged. Remember that asking
questions - whether in class or lab - is a sign of engagement in the material,
not an expression of weakness!

## Office Hours

The instructor will not schedule formal office hours, but will be available
immediately before or after lecture and at the start of lab sections to address
student questions on all aspects of the course.

The engineering staff and teaching assistant will be very available during lab
sections to assist students with lab work and address broader questions about
homework and other technical course content.

Please bear in mind that the instruction staff have many other responsibilities,
so try to make the most of these built-in opportunities for interaction.

If an issue cannot be adequately addressed at the above times, or if you need
additional help, we may be able to briefly meet with you individually; send us
e-mail to try to schedule an appointment, or feel free to drop by our offices
whenever the door is open.

## Course & Reference Materials

The course development and instruction team will be preparing lecture notes,
homework and quiz problems, and labs exercises that will be distributed at the
appropriate times. Together with an evolving educational radio kit for
laboratory exercises, we have started to refer to all these materials as
_RadioWare_. Your careful review of, feedback on, and even contribution to these
materials will be very appreciated.

The required textbook for the course is:

- Michael Rice, _Digital Communications: A Discrete-Time Approach_, Second
  Edition, Self Published, 2020. Available from Amazon at
  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GVGCKCC](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GVGCKCC)

Furthermore, there are several recommended reference texts from which may we
select some content and exercises:

- Travis F. Collins, Robin Getz, Di Pu, and Alexander M. Wyglinski,
  _Software-Defined Radio for Engineers_, Artech House, 2018. Available online
  at
  [https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/software-defined-radio-for-engineers.html](https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/software-defined-radio-for-engineers.html)
- David L. Adamy, _Introduction to Electronic Warfare Modeling and Simulation_,
  SciTech Publishing, 2006. Available online at
  [https://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpIEWMS004/introduction-electronic/introduction-electronic](https://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpIEWMS004/introduction-electronic/introduction-electronic)

## Homework

Homework will consist of problem sets and lab reports, each described in further
detail below. You are expected to complete all assigned homework problems and
lab exercises, though a randomly chosen subset will likely be graded.

Although the grade you get on your homework is only one component of your course
grade, working through, and often struggling at length with, the problem sets
and lab exercises is a crucial part of the learning process and will invariably
have a major impact on your understanding of the material. This understanding
will, in turn, be reflected in your exam performance and overall course grade.

Some items in the problem sets and lab execises may be labeled as "Optional".
You can make use of these items if you feel you might benefit from some
additional exposure to the material or if you are simply interested. Optional
items we will not be graded, but we will provide solutions to them along with
those for the regular problems.

### Problem Sets

There will be problem sets approximately every week.

We expect to issue problem sets Mondays and have them due a week and a half
later on Wednesdays at the end of class. Solutions will be distributed at the
end of the due dateâ€™s lecture; consequently, late problem sets cannot be
seriously evaluated.

Moderate collaboration with one or two classmates is permitted, provided your
writeups are your own.

### Lab Exercises & Reports

Laboratory work will serve as an important reinforcement and extension of topics
covered in lectures.

The lab exercises aim to familiarize students with practical issues in building
and testing radio communication systems, including the areas of analog and
digital hardware, software programming, measurements, and technical
documentation.

Lab exercises will primarily be worked during lab sections, but students will be
able to access the equipment outside of lab sections subject to coordination
with the instruction team.

Lab work will be conducted in teams of 2 students, but lab reports should be
written up separately.

## Quizzes & Exam

### Concept Quizzes

At the end of each learning module, we will have an short, in-class "concept
quiz" to check understanding and provide feedback to the instruction team.

We expect learning modules to collect related topics and last about 3 weeks, on
average.

Suggestions for quiz problems are always welcome, and come with an obvious
benefit to you if your problem is chosen!

### Midterm Exam

Each student will meet individually in the lab with members of the course
development and instruction team and will be asked to assemble a functioning
communications system using the lab kit. They will be evaluated on their methods
and overall success. Students should also be prepared to address questions about
course topics covered up to the date of the midterm exam.

We anticipate scheduling the midterm exams during the lab sections the week just
before Spring Break, February 28 and March 02, 2022.

This exam is designed to ensure that each student (outside of a group dynamic)
is absorbing the course concepts and becoming proficient in the lab setting.

## Final Project

The last several lab sections, nominally 4, will provide student groups with the
opportunity to extend the lab kit to address a challenging scenario related to
congested and contested radio spectrum.

The final scenario will be suggested by the instruction team and their research
collaborators, and students will propose a solution, develop and test it, and
present it to the class and instruction team for feedback along the way.

Specifically, after the first week students will present their approaches to
each other for anonymous "red-team" peer critique. Weeks two and three will be
spent implementing the proposed team solution. In the fourth and final week,
research collaborators will be invited to visit campus or participate via web
conference for final review of presentations and demonstrsations.

We anticipate scheduling the final project presentations and demonstrations
during the lab sections the last week of class, April 29 and 30, 2020.

## Course Grade

Your course grade will be based upon our best assessment of your understanding
of the material covered during the semester. Roughly, the weights used in the
grade assignment will be:

- Homework: 30% (Nominally Problem Sets: 10%, Lab Reports: 20%)
- Concept Quizzes: 20%
- Midterm Exam: 25%
- Final Project: 25%

However, other factors such as participation and interactions in meetings can
make a non-negligible difference in the course grade. In general, the process of
assigning a course grade involves careful review of performance in all aspects
of the course. Although the focus of the course is obviously learning, not
grades, we know the course grade is important to you, and we want you to know
that we take the process seriously.
