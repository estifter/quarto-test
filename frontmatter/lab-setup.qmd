## Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to assist RadioWare instructors as well as
teaching assistants in ordering equipment and supplies as well as setting up a
functioning laboratory environment for their students. The RadioWare laboratory
exercises utilize two bench configurations: a Student Team Bench and a Lab
Assistant Bench. Each lab section will have one Student Team Bench for each
group of 2-3 students as well as 1-2 Lab Assistant Benches. The equipment,
connections, software, and other configurations of these benches are described
below. Finally, the instructors and teaching assistants will prepare an
Educational Radio Kit for each student group as outlined in this document.

## Student Team Bench

The Student Team Bench provides intermediate frequency (IF) test and measurement
capabilities, power supplies, and a desktop computer for instrument control,
visualization, and software development. An example Student Team Bench is
pictured below.

: Lab Kit Parts List {#tbl-parts-list}

Each Educational Radio Kit is provided to students in an organizer, e.g., XXXX.

## Software Installation

This section summarizes the high-level requirements and selected software
components. Each semester the course development team surveys the software
landscape to update this section, with an emphasis on keeping the number of
dependencies and constraints and small as possible, and the installation
instructions as robust as possible.

Although much of the software is compatible with various operating systems
including Linux and Mac OS X, these instructions are for the laboratory
computers with Windows installed. Users of other operating systems who come up
with a robust set of installation instructions are welcome to share them with
the course development team for inclusion on this document.

<!-- Should we create our own "distribution" like Anaconda does for machine learning? Perhaps companies like Analog Devices and Keysight would sponsor it? -->

### High-Level Requirements

The high-level software requirements for the RadioWare courseware are as
follows:

- Interface support selected hardware, including: ADALM-2000, ADALM Pluto, and
  Keysight Test and Measurement Equipment
- Numerical Python, including Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, JupyText and
  Jupyter Notebook
- Link performance applications, including FFmpeg, iPerf, and Wireshark

### Hardware Dependency Analysis

Because the hardware is so critical, we start with a review of the state of
hardware drivers, their requirements, and baseline installations. From this
analysis, we determine the additional software that must be installed.

### ADALM-2000 / ADALM-Pluto Drivers

- Webpage:
  [https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win/releases](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win/releases)

### LibM2K

### Firmware Updates

- Oscilloscope: Keysight MSOX3014T firmware version 7.50.20211028 retrieved from
  [https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/instrument-firmware-software/installing-infiniivision-3000t-xseries-oscilloscope-firmware-2573488.html](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/instrument-firmware-software/installing-infiniivision-3000t-xseries-oscilloscope-firmware-2573488.html)
  and installed using an USB drive.
- Spectrum Analyzer: Keysight N9914B FieldFox firmware version A.12.35 from
  [https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/instrument-firmware-software/fieldfox-current-firmware-new-cpu-2637691.html](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/instrument-firmware-software/fieldfox-current-firmware-new-cpu-2637691.html)
  (USB drive)

### Installation Instructions

**Key Note:** Try to run all the setups as administrator and select any path in
C drive other than your user folder if that option is available. You can also
verify this later by making sure that the folder path of the executable file
does not contain your username.

#### Google Chrome and Git

**Install Google Chrome**
[https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/?standalone=1](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/?standalone=1)
Copy the setup file to a location in the C drive and the run the installer, also
make it the default browser.

**Install GitHub Desktop**
[https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/7582](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/7582)
Please follow the second comment by 'steveward' and install the .msi file (as
administrator). Whenever a new user logs in the PC, GitHub Desktop auto installs
itself on that users folder. This will be beneficial as we don't have to take
special care for cloning the entire course folder from GitHub.

Note: We can install TeamViewer in case we need remote access.

#### Python

1.  Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/)
    and scroll down to the Files section and click on the recommended Windows
    installer (64-bit). As a safe intermediate step you may first uninstall the
    currenly Python 3.7.4 version that you have by running the installer and
    selecting the uninstall option.

2.  Right click and run the installer you just downloaded as administrator and
    then select `Add Python 3.8 to PATH` in the checkbox shown at the bottom of
    the installation page. Click "Custom Installation" and follow the steps, we
    need to make sure that the folder path is general and not in our user.

3.  Congratulations! You have just succesfully installed Python. To check if
    Python is properly installed and added to PATH, first open the "Command
    Prompt" by typing `cmd` in your Cortana search box. Then, type `python` in
    your command window and press "Enter". You should expect to see information
    similar to the following:

    ```
    PPython 3.8.10 (tags/v3.8.10:3d8993a, May 3 2021, 11:48:03) [MSC v.1928 64 bit
    (AMD64)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more
    information. Type "quit()" to exit Python and return to the command window.
    ```

4.  Now run the command prompt as an administrator and upgrade your pip package
    by running `pip install --upgrade pip` command.

#### Numpy, MatPlotLib, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook, JupyText and PySimpleGUI

1.  Once we have Python installed, we could install other tools such as NumPy,
    MatPlotLib, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook, JupyText and PySimpleGUI using the "pip
    install" command (run command window as administrator then it should show
    C:\system\windows32 and not your username). Type pip install xyz in thr
    command window; the xyz should be replaced (one by one) by numpy,
    matplotlib, scipy, notebook, jupytext and pysimplegui.
2.  To test whether all these packages are installed and can be imported we can
    use command prompt and start python, then use the command import
    'package-name' and press enter (for pysimplegui use PySimpleGUI, check
    [https://yasoob.me/2013/07/28/what-is-**init**-py/](https://yasoob.me/2013/07/28/what-is-__init__-py/)
    for more details).

_Note:_ a) NumPy library is a collection of mathematical functions and it
supports arrays and matrices. b) MatPlotLib library used for Matlab like
plotting. c) SciPy library has modules that can be used for scientific
computational tasks such as optimization, linear algebra, etc. d) PySimpleGUI
library is used for fast and simple GUI programming. e) JupyText is used to open
Jupyter notebooks as text files.

    "libm2k-0.5.0-Windows-setup.exe"
2.  Run the installer (as administrator) and make sure to deselect just the
    option 'install Python 3.7 bindings', then click next to finish installing
    libm2k on your Windows system.
3.  To check the installation we should again run the command 'import libm2k' in
    the python terminal (in command prompt type python and click enter).<br>

The idea of first installing libiio and then overwriting it is taken from the
question thread

   Remove ffmpeg and iperf from system path environment variables and delete
   those folders in C drive. b) Go to 'Program files' and first delete Python38,
   then delete IVI and Keysight related folders too. c) Go to 'Program files
   (x86)' and delete Agilent, GitHub, IVI, Keysight, Visual Studio, NI and
   Wibukey related folders. d) Go to the hidden folder (select view hidden in
   the file explorer) 'Program Data' and delete Agilent, IVI and Keysight. e) Go
   to Users and then to your folder. Now first go to Documents and delete the
   GitHub folder (radioware repository) and come back to Users folder. Then
   delete .ipython, .jupyter, .matplotlib folders and .gitconfig file. Also go
   to the hidden folder 'AppData', delete GitHub and Jupyter folder in Roaming.
   Now go to the local folder and first delete the pip folder and then delete
   GitHub, Keysight and temp folders. f) Go to Windows folder and delete
   Temp.<br>
