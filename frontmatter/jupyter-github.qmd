## Github Classroom

The purpose of this brief document is to help students start the Github
classroom; clone the repository

First Let's start signing in your github account, you can sign in by the link:
[https://classroom.github.com/](https://classroom.github.com/)

- click the green button "Authorize GitHub Classroom"
- Copy the link:
  [https://classroom.github.com/a/VPOQqQ3j](https://classroom.github.com/a/VPOQqQ3j)
  to join the classroom NDEE-41453-Spring-2022.
- You can choose your name from the "Identifiers" menu.
- Then you can create a team or join the team that your teammate created.
- After you create or join the team, you can see the status below:

- Accepted the assignment, and login your github account through the github
  desktop.
- Clone the repository you just build by joining the team.
- Then you can find the folder you just clone in: C:\Users\"Your
  NDID"\Documents\GitHub\ndee-41453-lab01-"your team name"

## Jupyter Fast Start

The purpose of this brief document is to help students start the Jupyter
Notebook server; create, save, and open notebooks; run notebooks; and finally
shutdown the kernels as well as the server. Where helpful, screenshots are
included.

Two important caveats:

- This document is intended to be printed on hardcopy, to best assist students
  who are completely unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebook. It should be as short as
  possible.

- This document illustrates use on Windows 10 with all Python, Jupyter, and
  associated libraries already installed. However, the instructions should be
  applicable to Mac OS X and Linux platforms as well.

### Starting Jupyter Notebook Server

The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application which integrates code and
its output into a single document that combines live code, visualizations,
narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media.

To start the Jupyter Notebook Server, open the Windows cmd and enter the
following command:<br> jupyter notebook

Note that you will only have access to the files and subfolders within Jupyter's
start-up directory. For example, if the following command is entered in cmd:<br>
C:\Users\\"Your NDID"\Documents\GitHub\radioware\labs>Jupyter Notebook<br>

Then you will only be able to see and edit files under the folder called "labs".

To change the start-up directory, you could either "cd" into the directory you
would like to start the Jupyter with. For example, you could type in the command
line:<br> cd "the address of the directory (don't include the quotes)"<br>

#### Alternatively, you could simply first open the directory in Windows File Explorer and then type "cmd" in the address bar.

### Navigating Directories

Once the Jupyter Notebook server is initiated, your web browser should open a
new tab containing directories similar to what are shown in the screenshot
below: <br>
<img src="https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jupyter-dashboard.jpg">

1. Similar to the default file explorer system of Windows, you are able to
   navigate to different folders by simply clicking the folder names.
2. Because the notebook is a web-based application, to return to the previous
   directory, you could simply "go back to the previous page" using your
   browser. Alternatively, you could click the top "folder" with name ".." to
   return to the parent folder.

### Creating Notebooks

1. To create our first notebook, first navigate to the folder in which we would
   like to create a new Jupyter notebook.
2. Then, on the top-right corner, click "New" and select "Python 3" notebook.
3. A new browser tab will pop up with the name "Untitled" (see the screenshot
   below), click "Untilted" to rename the notebook to "MyFirstNotebook", for
   example.
4. The box with "ln []" in it is the basic unit of Jupyter Notebook, called a
   cell.
5. To add some content to our first notebook, type the following code in the
   cell and then click the save icon: <br> a="Hello " <br> b="World!" <br>
   print(a+b) <br>
6. To run the cell, click the cell and then click the "Run" icon, which should
   print out the message "Hello World!" below the cell.
7. To insert a new cell, after selecting an existing cell, go to
   "Insert"->"Insert Cell Above" or "Insert Cell Below"
8. To delete a cell, select the cell the then go to "Edit"-> "Delete Cells".

### Saving and Closing Notebooks

1. To save the notebook, simply click the "Save and Checkpoint" icon on the
   top-left corner.
2. Then we could close the notebook by closing the browser tab.

### Shutting Down Kernels

1. To shutdown the kernel, first locate the directory/folder where our Jupyter
   notebook is located.
2. Click the checkbox on the left of the notebook file, and the click "Shutdown"
   to shutdown the kernel.
3. To verify that all kernels have been properly shutdown, you could go to the
   tab "Running" and make sure there are no running Jupyter processes.
4. Alternatively, before closing the notebook browser tab, you could close the
   notebook and shutdown the kernel simultaneously by going to "File"->"Close
   and Halt"

### Quitting the Jupyter Notebook Server

After properly saving the notebook, closing the notebook and shutting down the
kernels, we could quit the Jupyter Notebook Server by closing the web browser
and pressing Ctrl+Break to exit the command line.

### Uploading Your Report

After quitting the jupyter notebook server, you can open Github Desktop,
selecting the file "report" and clicking "commit". Then click push to update the
file in the github website.
