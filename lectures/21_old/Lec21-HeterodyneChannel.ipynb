    "In this lecture, we will extend Lectures 14-16 to develop a detailed channel model for the heterodyne transmitter and receiver sub-systems, including mixer leakage and self-mixing, oscillator frequency offsets, and interference. This will allow us to consider an important design topic called frequency planning, and to apply it to our laboratory radios in the context of ISM band interference."

    "* The baseband bandwidth $B$\n",

We therefore are inclined to push our transmitter's RF output to the lower part of the passband of the RF filter, i.e., use subheterodyne modulation and demodulation, and reduce the impact of this interference. The specific design used in the lab will be therefore be as follows:\n",
