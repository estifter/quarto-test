Where helpful, screenshots are\nincluded.\n\nTwo important caveats:\n\n- This document is intended to be printed on hardcopy, to best assist students\n  who are completely unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebook. It should be as short as\n  possible.\n\n- This document illustrates use on Windows 10 with all Python, Jupyter, and\n  associated libraries already installed. However, the instructions should be\n  applicable to Mac OS X and Linux platforms as well.\n\n### Starting Jupyter Notebook Server\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application which integrates code and\nits output into a single document that combines live code, visualizations,\nnarrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media.\n\nTo start the Jupyter Notebook Server, open the Windows cmd and enter the\nfollowing command:<br> jupyter notebook\n\nNote that you will only have access to the files and subfolders within Jupyter's\nstart-up directory. For example, if the following command is entered in cmd:<br>\nC:\\Users\\\\\"Your NDID\"\\Documents\\GitHub\\radioware\\labs>Jupyter Notebook<br>\n\nThen you will only be able to see and edit files under the folder called \"labs\".\n\nTo change the start-up directory, you could either \"cd\" into the directory you\nwould like to start the Jupyter with. For example, you could type in the command\nline:<br> cd \"the address of the directory (don't include the quotes)\"<br>\n\n#### Alternatively, you could simply first open the directory in Windows File Explorer and then type \"cmd\" in the address bar.\n\n### Navigating Directories\n\nOnce the Jupyter Notebook server is initiated, your web browser should open a\nnew tab containing directories similar to what are shown in the screenshot\nbelow: <br>\n<img src=\"https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jupyter-dashboard.jpg\">\n\n1. Similar to the default file explorer system of Windows, you are able to\n   navigate to different folders by simply clicking the folder names.\n2. Because the notebook is a web-based application, to return to the previous\n   directory, you could simply \"go back to the previous page\" using your\n   browser. Alternatively, you could click the top \"folder\" with name \"..\" to\n   return to the parent folder.\n\n### Creating Notebooks\n\n1. To create our first notebook, first navigate to the folder in which we would\n   like to create a new Jupyter notebook.\n2. Then, on the top-right corner, click \"New\" and select \"Python 3\" notebook.\n3. A new browser tab will pop up with the name \"Untitled\" (see the screenshot\n   below), click \"Untilted\" to rename the notebook to \"MyFirstNotebook\", for\n   example.\n4. The box with \"ln []\" in it is the basic unit of Jupyter Notebook, called a\n   cell.\n5. To add some content to our first notebook, type the following code in the\n   cell and then click the save icon: <br> a=\"Hello \" <br> b=\"World!\" <br>\n   print(a+b) <br>\n6. To run the cell, click the cell and then click the \"Run\" icon, which should\n   print out the message \"Hello World!\" below the cell.\n7. To insert a new cell, after selecting an existing cell, go to\n   \"Insert\"->\"Insert Cell Above\" or \"Insert Cell Below\"\n8. To delete a cell, select the cell the then go to \"Edit\"-> \"Delete Cells\".\n   <img src=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/02_new_notebook.015b2f84bb60.png\">\n\n### Saving and Closing Notebooks\n\n1. To save the notebook, simply click the \"Save and Checkpoint\" icon on the\n   top-left corner.\n2. Then we could close the notebook by closing the browser tab.\n\n### Shutting Down Kernels\n\n1. To shutdown the kernel, first locate the directory/folder where our Jupyter\n   notebook is located.\n2. Click the checkbox on the left of the notebook file, and the click \"Shutdown\"\n   to shutdown the kernel.\n3. To verify that all kernels have been properly shutdown, you could go to the\n   tab \"Running\" and make sure there are no running Jupyter processes.\n4. Alternatively, before closing the notebook browser tab, you could close the\n   notebook and shutdown the kernel simultaneously by going to \"File\"->\"Close\n   and Halt\"\n\n### Quitting the Jupyter Notebook Server\n\nAfter properly saving the notebook, closing the notebook and shutting down the\nkernels, we could quit the Jupyter Notebook Server by closing the web browser\nand pressing Ctrl+Break to exit the command line.\n\n### Uploading Your Report\n\nAfter quitting the jupyter notebook server, you can open Github Desktop,\nselecting the file \"report\" and clicking \"commit\". Then click push to update the\nfile in the github website.\n\n## References\n\n1.
